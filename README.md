### Gavin Bulthuis' Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects showcasing my expertise in data science, sports analytics, and machine learning. This repository is a testament to my passion for solving complex problems, building impactful models, and applying technical skills to real-world scenarios, particularly in the sports domain.

## üèÜ About Me

Name: Gavin Bulthuis

Background: Data Science Major at the University of Minnesota

Passions: Solving complex problems and generating actionable insights with data

Goal: To leverage data science and engineering skills to drive decision-making for companies

## üìÇ Portfolio Highlights

1. Sports Analytics Projects

Go for Two or to not Go for Two?: Analyzed NFL teams decison process of kicking an extra point or going for a two point conversion. Created expected points metric to help assist teams in making the optimal choice.

Comparing Players Across Different Positions in the NFL: Implemented a K-means clustering algorithm to rank NFL players across different positons.

Traveling Tournament Problem Research: Researched different Artificial Intelligence algorithms to apply to a major league baseball schedule that minimizes the distance traveled for teams. Found that using a tiling phase and local neighborhood seach produced minimized schedules at an 85% rate.

Predicting QB Passing Yards: Built simple Linear Regression model to predict Quarterback passing yards (in progress).

2. Machine Learning & Optimization

Temperature Prediction: Built models using Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, KNN Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Bagging Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Adaboost Regression to predict the temperature on a given day. Best performing model was Random Forests with an average 5-fold cross validated RMSE of 2.57 with an adjusted r-squared of 0.94.

Cyber Attack Classification: Utilized modeling techniques such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forests to classify cyber attacks and locate common patterns among them in hopes to implement the model for companies.

Neural Network (MNIST): Developed a hand-written digit recognition model with regularization and step size tuning that achieved an accuracy of 95%.

## üöÄ Skills

Programming Languages: Python, R, Julia, SQL, C, Java

Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Sk-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PyTorch, Tensorflow, PySpark, GGplot, Dplyr, Caret, nflfastR

Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Means Clustering, Neural Networks, Linear Regression, XGBoost, Adaboost, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Bagging

## üìä Key Metrics & Achievements

Developed a profitable sports analytics business from the ground up.

Contributed to major football analytics business success at The 33rd Team and PFF.

Managed analytics for Barstool‚Äôs 2M+ follower network and drove impactful social media campaigns on campus.
