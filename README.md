### Gavin Bulthuis' Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects showcasing my expertise sports analytics and machine learning. This repository is a testament to my passion for solving complex problems, building impactful models, and applying technical skills to real-world scenarios, particularly in the sports domain.

## About Me

Name: Gavin Bulthuis

Background: Data Science Major at the University of Minnesota

Passions: Solving complex problems and generating actionable insights with data.

Goal: To leverage data science and engineering skills to drive decision-making for companies.

## Portfolio Highlights

1. Sports Analytics Projects

Go for Two or to not Go for Two?: Analyzed NFL teams decison process of kicking an extra point or going for a two point conversion. Created expected points metric to help assist teams in making the optimal choice.

March Madness Prediction: XGBoost Regression was applied to various college basketball metrics in hopes to find teams poised to make a run in the tournament. The model attempted to predict a "Win Score" that would tell us how far each team got in a given tournament. This win score was used to pick a bracket in 2025 and correctly identified all eight teams in the Elite 8 and scored in the 80th percentile of ESPN brackets.

Grouping NFL Players by Play Styles: Utilized Principal Component Analysis and K-means clustering to reduce the dimensionality and cluster players based on over 200 statistics for each player at each position. This method factors in important metrics other than production statistics such as primary field positioning and scheme roles to more accurately cluster similar players.

Tiering Players Across Different Positions in the NFL: Implemented a K-means clustering algorithm to evaluate NFL players across different positons.

SNC Player Grades: Built a weighted formula for each position that assigns each NFL player a grade based on a variety of relevant metrics. Metrics are pulled from various NFL data sources such as Pro Football Focus and NFL Next Gen Stats.

Traveling Tournament Problem Research: Researched different Artificial Intelligence algorithms to apply to a major league baseball schedule that minimizes the distance traveled for teams. Found that using a tiling phase and local neighborhood seach produced minimized schedules at an 85% rate.

2. Machine Learning Projects

Temperature Prediction: Built models using Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, KNN Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Bagging Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Adaboost Regression to predict the temperature on a given day.

Cyber Attack Classification: Utilized modeling techniques such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forests to classify cyber attacks and locate common patterns among them in hopes to implement the model for companies.

Activity Clustering using Motion Sensor Data: Applied dimensionality reduction and clustering methods such as K-Means Clustering, Spectral Clustering, and Hierarchical Clustering to discover biomechanical patterns between activities using motion sensor data.

3. Other

Baked GF Sales Dashboard: Built a RShiny application that assists my mother's baking business analyze baking costs, profits, sales, and more.
